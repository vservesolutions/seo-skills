# Weekend Article Blitz

Two articles, two days, end-to-end. Saturday = macro/strategic ("The AGI Bottleneck Triad"). Sunday = micro/tactical ("The Grid Can't Save You"). Cross-linked bidirectionally. Sunday is the actionable follow-up that makes Saturday's piece matter to the person reading on their phone while their API is throwing 503s.

Slug each article with date-prefixed format: `2026-05-02-agi-bottleneck-triad`

## 🗓️ SATURDAY: "The AGI Bottleneck Triad" (Macro / Strategic)

**Audience:** Strategists, investors, tech leaders
**Reader journey:** "Oh shit, the whole industry has a problem"
**SEO cluster:** "AGI bottleneck"
**Internal links:** → AI Infrastructure Gap, → AI Energy Crisis: 503, → Sovereign AI Stack 2026

### Step 1: Research & Dedup (Friday Night or Saturday AM)

- Research already exists in memory/archive/ai-energy-crisis-research/ and memory/article-ideas-pending.md
- Action: Audit articles.phantom-byte.com for overlap, existing pieces cover AI Energy Crisis and Infrastructure Gap, this piece must go broader connecting power + compute + efficiency as a unified argument
- Action: Run the swarm or draft directly

### Step 2: Draft (Saturday Morning)

- **Target:** 2,500-4,000 words (top performers are long-form)
- **Structure:**
  - **H1:** The AGI Bottleneck Triad: Power, Compute, and the Efficiency Crisis Nobody Wants to Admit
  - **Section 1, The Power Problem:** Data centers pulling state-level electricity. Grid is 100 years old. FERC fights. Behind-the-meter generation. SMR timeline misses the mark.
  - **Section 2, The Compute Problem:** TSMC can't fab fast enough. GPU allocations are a blood sport. MoE and MLA as architectural escapes, not just optimizations.
  - **Section 3, The Efficiency Solution:** DeepSeek proved you don't need a nuclear plant. Curated data beats brute force. Smart architecture buys time.
  - **Conclusion, All Three Legs:** "AGI needs all three legs of the stool, and we're limping on at least two."
- **Voice:** Brutal truth, "I" statements, real numbers, zero corporate PR
- **Format:** Follow PhantomByte writing style (load `phantom-byte-writing-style` skill)
- **NO EM DASHES anywhere**

### Step 3: SEO & Meta (Saturday Midday)

- **Meta title:** AGI Bottleneck Triad: Power, Compute & Efficiency Crisis 2026 (60 chars)
- **Meta desc:** AI's path to AGI isn't blocked by algorithms, it's blocked by substations, chip fabs, and inefficient architectures. Here's why. (155 chars)
- **Primary keyword:** "AGI bottleneck" (H1, first paragraph, 2-3 H2s)
- **Internal links:** → AI Infrastructure Gap, → AI Energy Crisis: 503, → Sovereign AI Stack 2026
- **External links:** IEA report, FERC filing, DeepSeek architecture paper
- **JSON-LD schema:** NewsArticle or TechArticle

### Step 4: Social Assets (Saturday PM)

- **Pinterest:** "AGI Bottleneck Triad Explained, Why Your AI Can't Scale" (2:3 pin, text overlay, brand colors)
- **X.com:** "AGI doesn't need better algorithms. It needs a substation, a fab, and a thermodynamics lesson. New piece on why 🔥" (190 chars)
- **Telegram:** Brief announcement with link

### Step 5: Publish (Saturday Evening)

- Post to articles.phantom-byte.com
- Push social assets
- Update ARTICLE-TRACKER

---

## 🗓️ SUNDAY: "The Grid Can't Save You" (Micro / Tactical)

**Audience:** Developers, DevOps, SREs, indie hackers
**Reader journey:** "Oh shit, MY app has this problem right now"
**SEO cluster:** "AI 503 errors" + "AI power shortage"
**Internal links:** → Saturday's Triad piece (cross-link both ways), → AI Energy Crisis: 503, → Sovereign AI Stack

### Step 1: Research & Angle Refinement (Saturday Night)

- Pull from competitive analysis gaps (#1 and #3):
  - Gap #1: 503 ↔ Power Crisis connection
  - Gap #3: Multi-Tenant Power Problem
- Fresh research needed:
  - Recent OpenAI/Anthropic API incident reports
  - CAISO/ERCOT demand data (heat wave correlations)
  - "At capacity" message screenshots
  - Cloud region availability fluctuations

### Step 2: Draft (Sunday Morning)

- **Target:** 2,500-3,500 words
- **Structure:**
  - **H1:** The Grid Can't Save You: Why Your AI App Will Fail Before Your Model Does
  - **Hook:** You've seen the 503s. You've blamed your code. Here's what's really happening.
  - **Section 1, Your 503 Isn't a Bug:** API outages mapped to grid stress events. The correlation nobody's publishing.
  - **Section 2, The Multi-Tenant Power Problem:** When power is scarce, who gets the tokens? Priority routing during brownouts. Your app is last in line.
  - **Section 3, Heat Waves, Slow Responses, and the Electricity You Can't See:** Latency-energy tradeoff. Why your app is slow at 3 PM in July.
  - **Section 4, Building Fault-Tolerant AI Apps:** Multi-region failover based on power availability, not just latency. Graceful degradation patterns. Batching strategies during grid stress.
  - **Section 5, Sovereign AI Isn't Just Philosophy, It's Reliability:** Tie back to existing coverage. Why local inference = uptime guarantee.
- **Voice:** Same brutal truth voice, but this time from the trenches. Developer-to-developer.
- **Format:** PhantomByte writing style
- **NO EM DASHES**

### Step 3: SEO & Meta (Sunday Midday)

- **Meta title:** Why Your AI App Fails: Grid Power, 503 Errors & Multi-Tenant AI (60 chars)
- **Meta desc:** Your 503s aren't bugs, they're power shortage symptoms. How grid constraints break AI apps and what to do about it. (155 chars)
- **Primary keyword:** "AI 503 errors power shortage" (H1, intro, 2 H2s)
- **Internal links:** → AI Energy Crisis: 503, → Sovereign AI Stack, → The Grid Can't Save You pairs with Saturday's Triad piece (cross-link both)
- **External links:** IEA data, CAISO/ERCOT dashboards, OpenAI status page
- **JSON-LD schema:** NewsArticle or TechArticle

### Step 4: Social Assets (Sunday PM)

- **Pinterest:** "AI App Failing? It Might Be the Power Grid, Not Your Code" (2:3 pin)
- **X.com:** "Your 503 errors aren't bugs. They're power shortage symptoms. New piece on what the grid means for your app uptime ⚡" (190 chars)
- **Telegram:** Announcement + link back to Saturday's piece ("If yesterday's Triad was the diagnosis, today is the prescription")

### Step 5: Publish (Sunday Evening)

- Post to articles.phantom-byte.com
- Push social assets
- Update ARTICLE-TRACKER
- Cross-link Saturday ↔ Sunday articles bidirectionally

## 📊 Sequence Strategy

| Scope | Saturday (Macro) | Sunday (Micro) |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Scope | Why AGI is stuck (macro) | Why your app is stuck (micro) |
| Reader Journey | "Oh shit, the whole industry has a problem" | "Oh shit, MY app has this problem right now" |
| Internal Linking | Points to existing Infrastructure + Energy articles | Points to Saturday piece + Sovereign AI + 503 article |
| SEO Net | "AGI bottleneck" cluster | "AI 503 errors" + "AI power shortage" cluster |
| Audience | Strategists, investors, tech leaders | Developers, DevOps, SREs, indie hackers |

Sunday's piece is the actionable follow-up that makes Saturday's piece matter to the developer reading on their phone while their API is throwing 503s.

## Universal Rules (Both Days)

1. **NO EM DASHES**, use periods, parentheses, or colons instead
2. **PhantomByte voice:** First-person, visceral opening, pragmatic, battle-tested, slightly irreverent
3. **SEO first:** Primary keyword in H1, first paragraph, 2-3 H2s
4. **File delivery via UNC paths only**, never dump article text into Telegram
5. **Update ARTICLE-TRACKER** after each publish
6. **Cross-link Saturday ↔ Sunday bidirectionally** upon publishing Sunday's piece
7. **Slug format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-short-descriptive-slug`

## Execution Options

- **Option A (swarm):** Run `article-blaster` pipeline per article if research exists
- **Option B (manual draft):** Write directly following structure above
- **Trigger phrases:** "run weekend blitz", "Saturday article", "Sunday article", "weekend articles", "article blitz", "run weekend blueprint"
