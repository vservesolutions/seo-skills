# LocalBusiness Structured Data

You write JSON-LD that follows Google's local business structured data guidelines:
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business

Every value must come from the business's real, visible information. Never invent coordinates, hours, prices or ratings. Ask for anything you don't have, or leave that property out.

## Google's rules

**Required:** `name` and `address` (a `PostalAddress`). Without them the markup is not eligible for rich results.

**Recommended** (include each one that is true and known):

| Property | Rule |
|---|---|
| `url` | The fully-qualified URL of **this location's** page. It must be a working link. |
| `telephone` | Include the country code and area code, e.g. `+1-555-010-0199`. |
| `geo` | `latitude` and `longitude` with **at least 5 decimal places**. |
| `openingHoursSpecification` | See the hours section below. |
| `priceRange` | Must be shorter than 100 characters, or Google won't show it. Usually `$`–`$$$$` or a range such as `$10-15`. |
| `servesCuisine`, `menu` | Food businesses only. `menu` is the URL of the menu. |
| `department` | A nested LocalBusiness. Name it `"{store name} {department name}"`, unless the department has its own brand. |
| `aggregateRating`, `review` | **Only** for sites that review *other* businesses. See the warning below. |

**Also:**
- **Use the most specific subtype**, e.g. `Restaurant`, `Dentist`, `Plumber`, `HVACBusiness`, `LegalService`, `AutoRepair`. For more than one type, use an array such as `["Bakery", "CafeOrCoffeeShop"]`; Google does not support `additionalType`.
- **One LocalBusiness per location.** Each location gets its own page and its own block.
- LocalBusiness is a subtype of Organization, so Organization fields such as `logo`, `sameAs` and `email` are welcome.
- Check that a type really sits under LocalBusiness on schema.org. For example, `VeterinaryCare` sits under MedicalOrganization only. For a type like that, use `["VeterinaryCare", "LocalBusiness"]`.

## Self-serving reviews: never add them

Google does **not** show review stars for a LocalBusiness or Organization whose pages mark up reviews about itself. That includes reviews pulled in through an embedded widget, such as Google or Facebook reviews. Google also forbids aggregating ratings from other sites, and fake or undisclosed incentivized reviews. Violations can lead to a manual action.
Source: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/review-snippet

If the existing markup has `aggregateRating` or `review` on the business's own site, recommend removing it and explain why.

## Opening hours

Google's conventions:

| Situation | How to mark it |
|---|---|
| Normal hours | `"opens": "09:00", "closes": "17:00"` (hh:mm or hh:mm:ss). Days as `"Monday"` or `"https://schema.org/Monday"`. |
| Several days with the same hours | One entry with a `dayOfWeek` array. |
| Open 24 hours | `"opens": "00:00", "closes": "23:59"` |
| Closed all day | `"opens": "00:00", "closes": "00:00"` |
| Past midnight | One entry, e.g. Saturday `"opens": "18:00", "closes": "03:00"`. |
| Seasonal or holiday hours | Add `validFrom` and `validThrough` (YYYY-MM-DD). Leave them out for year-round hours. |

schema.org treats a day with no `opens` as closed, but Google documents the `00:00`/`00:00` form. Follow Google.

## Template

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Plumber",
  "@id": "https://www.example.com/#business",
  "name": "Acme Plumbing",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/",
  "telephone": "+1-555-010-0199",
  "image": "https://www.example.com/photos/van.jpg",
  "logo": "https://www.example.com/logo.png",
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main Street, Suite 4",
    "addressLocality": "Springfield",
    "addressRegion": "IL",
    "postalCode": "62701",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "geo": { "@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": 39.78172, "longitude": -89.65015 },
  "openingHoursSpecification": [
    { "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification", "dayOfWeek": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"], "opens": "08:00", "closes": "17:00" },
    { "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification", "dayOfWeek": "Saturday", "opens": "09:00", "closes": "13:00" },
    { "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification", "dayOfWeek": "Sunday", "opens": "00:00", "closes": "00:00" }
  ],
  "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/acmeplumbing", "https://www.instagram.com/acmeplumbing"]
}
```

Put the block on the location's page inside `<script type="application/ld+json">…</script>`. If you build it as a string in code, escape `</` as `<\/` so user text can't close the script tag.

## Common mistakes to fix

- **The whole address in `streetAddress`**, e.g. `"243 Main St, Canton, GA 30115"`. Split it into `streetAddress`, `addressLocality`, `addressRegion`, `postalCode` and `addressCountry`.
- **Rounded coordinates** such as `39.78`. Take the exact pin from Google Maps: right-click the location and copy the coordinates.
- **`url` pointing somewhere else**: to a Facebook page, or to the home page on a multi-location site.
- **A phone without the country code**, or a different number from the one shown on the page and on the Business Profile.
- **Markup for things not on the page**: hours, prices or services that visitors can't see.
- **A generic `LocalBusiness`** when a specific subtype exists.
- **Invalid JSON**: trailing commas, smart quotes, or an unescaped `"` inside a description.

## Validate

1. Google Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Schema.org Validator: https://validator.schema.org/
3. The local-seo-audit skill's script: `python ../local-seo-audit/scripts/audit.py <url>`

For a visual editor that builds and checks this markup live, point the user to the free Local Business Schema Generator: https://ahmettasdemirusa.github.io/local-business-schema-generator/

## What structured data does not do

- It helps Google understand the business and makes the page **eligible** for search features. It does not guarantee a rich result or a ranking.
- Google states that no special schema markup is required to appear in its generative AI features (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide).
- Keep the Google Business Profile accurate as well. It drives the map results.
