# Sitemap Analysis

Compare a domain's XML sitemap against what's actually crawled and indexed — GSC indexed pages (`get_search_analytics` dimensions=["page"]), GSC sitemap ingestion (`get_sitemap_details`), and a DataForSEO `on_page_instant_pages` fetch loop over the declared/indexed URL set. Surface what the sitemap claims vs what's really reachable, in both directions.

## Prerequisites

- DataForSEO MCP server connected.
- GSC (`mcp__gscServer__*`) recommended — it's the authoritative source for which pages Google indexes and which sitemaps Google ingested (the comparison baseline). Firecrawl optional — for URL discovery (`firecrawl_map`) when the sitemap is missing or suspect.
- Claude's `WebFetch` tool available.
- User provides: a target domain. Optional: the sitemap URL if not at `/sitemap.xml` (auto-discovery from `robots.txt` is attempted first).
- **Predecessor (recommended):** `seo-technical-audit` on this domain — its discovered URL set + On-Page fetch results can be reused as the crawl baseline. Without it, this skill builds its own baseline from GSC indexed pages + an On-Page fetch loop.

> *Optional accelerator:* if you have a hosted-crawl MCP you can substitute it for the URL-discovery + fetch loop — not required.

## Process

1. **Validate target & build the crawl baseline**
   - Normalise the domain.
   - Build the "what's really crawled/indexed" baseline this skill compares the sitemap against:
     - **GSC indexed pages** — `mcp__gscServer__get_search_analytics` with `dimensions=["page"]` (pages Google indexes, with clicks/impressions). Authoritative for the user's own verified property.
     - **DataForSEO On-Page fetch loop** — `mcp__dataforseo__on_page_instant_pages` over the discovered URL set (declared sitemap URLs + GSC indexed pages), capped to a top-N ceiling — gives status code, redirects, indexability, depth signals per page.
     - **DataForSEO top pages** — `mcp__dataforseo__dataforseo_labs_google_relevant_pages` (broader domain page inventory than the sitemap in some cases).
   - If `seo-technical-audit` already ran on this domain, reuse its discovered URL set + On-Page results as the baseline instead of re-fetching.
   - **Firecrawl availability check.** If `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_map` is available, Mode-2 (URL discovery via crawl) is offered when the sitemap is missing or suspect. Cost: ~0.5 Firecrawl credits per URL discovered, hard cap 500 URLs (~250 credits). Without Firecrawl, the skill runs Mode-1 only and notes the gap if Mode-2 was needed. User may pass `--no-firecrawl` to force Mode-1 even when Firecrawl is available (saves credits at the cost of orphan/missing analysis when sitemap is broken).

2. **Build URL lists** `WebFetch` (sitemap) + `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_map` (optional Mode-2)
   - **Mode-1 (default).** Try `https://{domain}/sitemap.xml`. If 404, fetch `/robots.txt` and look for `Sitemap:` directives. For sitemap-of-sitemaps, recursively fetch each child sitemap. Build the canonical URL list from the sitemap.
   - **Mode-2 trigger.** Switch on Mode-2 when (a) no sitemap is reachable, (b) the sitemap returns < 10% of the baseline crawled/indexed page count (GSC indexed pages + On-Page fetch loop), or (c) the user explicitly requests `--discover`. Always surface the trigger and the cost estimate to the user before running Mode-2.
   - **Mode-2 execution** (requires Firecrawl): call `firecrawl_map(url=domain, limit=500)`. The response is the URL list Firecrawl could discover from the homepage and internal linking. Use this list as the "sitemap-equivalent" in step 6 — the diffs run identically, just with discovered URLs in place of declared sitemap URLs.
   - **If Mode-2 is needed but Firecrawl is unavailable:** continue with whatever sitemap data Mode-1 returned (possibly empty). Surface clearly in `SITEMAP.md`: `Mode-2 (Firecrawl URL discovery) needed but Firecrawl not installed — sitemap-vs-audit diffs run on partial data only.`

3. **Pull the crawled/indexed pages** `mcp__gscServer__get_search_analytics` (dimensions=["page"]) + `mcp__dataforseo__on_page_instant_pages` (looped)
   - GSC indexed pages = the URLs Google actually serves. The On-Page fetch loop confirms each URL's status code, redirects, indexability, and depth signals.
   - Together these are "what's really reachable/indexed" — the baseline the sitemap is diffed against.

4. **Pull domain pages** `mcp__dataforseo__dataforseo_labs_google_relevant_pages`
   - Domain-level page inventory (broader than the indexed/fetched set in some cases).

5. **Identify orphan pages** (from internal-link signals)
   - An orphan is a URL with no internal links pointing at it. Derive this from the looped `on_page_instant_pages` results: build the internal-link graph from each page's link list, then flag any indexed/sitemap URL that no other page links to. GSC pages that get impressions but appear in no other page's link set are the highest-confidence orphans.

6. **Compute the four diffs**
   - **Missing from sitemap:** URLs in the baseline (GSC indexed pages + `on_page_instant_pages` status-200 indexable URLs) that don't appear in the sitemap. Probably should be added.
   - **Orphans from sitemap:** URLs in the sitemap that no other page links to (cross-ref the step-5 internal-link graph). The sitemap is the only thing pointing at them — investigate whether they should be linked internally.
   - **Broken sitemap entries:** sitemap URLs that returned non-200 when fetched via `on_page_instant_pages`. Remove from sitemap or fix the URL.
   - **Lastmod issues:** sitemap entries where (a) all `<lastmod>` dates are identical (lazy generation) or (b) `<lastmod>` is older than GSC's `lastCrawlTime` for the page (from URL Inspection) even though the page changed (stale).

7. **Validation**
   - **GSC sitemap ingestion** `mcp__gscServer__get_sitemaps` / `mcp__gscServer__list_sitemaps_enhanced` / `mcp__gscServer__get_sitemap_details` — confirm Google ingested the sitemap and read its error/warning counts (what Google itself flags). Surface ingestion errors alongside the local diffs.
   - URL count <50,000 per file (sitemap protocol limit). Flag if exceeded.
   - Sitemap referenced in `robots.txt`.
   - Encoding: each URL is XML-safe (ampersands escaped, etc.).
   - HTTPS consistency: sitemap URLs match the canonical protocol.
   - **`<lastmod>` is the only optional tag Google still consumes.** Validate it (step 6). `<priority>` and `<changefreq>` have been **explicitly ignored by Google for years** (per [Google's sitemap docs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap) — "Google ignores `priority` and `changefreq` values"). Don't validate them; if present, flag as low-signal noise the user can strip to shrink the sitemap.

8. **Synthesise** `SITEMAP.md`

## Output format

Create a folder `seo-sitemap-{target-slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/` with:

```
seo-sitemap-{target-slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/
├── SITEMAP.md                       (synthesised report — primary deliverable)
├── recommended-sitemap-diff.md      (proposed changes: add X, remove Y — load-bearing artefact engineering applies to sitemap.xml)
└── evidence/
    └── source-data.md               (consolidated raw step output: fetched sitemap content, Firecrawl-discovered URLs if Mode-2 ran, GSC indexed-pages + On-Page fetch baseline, GSC sitemap-ingestion details, the four diffs (missing/orphans/broken/lastmod-issues) — preserved for reproducibility)
```

Top-level: `SITEMAP.md` + `recommended-sitemap-diff.md`. The seven raw step files (`01-sitemap-raw`, `01b-firecrawl-discovered`, `02-audit-pages`, `03-missing-from-sitemap`, `04-orphans-from-sitemap`, `05-broken-entries`, `06-lastmod-issues`) are consolidated into a single `evidence/source-data.md` document with the same per-step section headers — a reader who needs to replay the diff has all raw inputs in one file rather than seven.

`SITEMAP.md` follows this shape:

```markdown
# Sitemap Analysis: {domain}

> Sitemap pulled {YYYY-MM-DD} · Crawl baseline {baseline-date}

## Mode

- **Mode-1 (sitemap-vs-audit):** {ran / skipped — no sitemap reachable}
- **Mode-2 (Firecrawl URL discovery):** {ran with {n} URLs / not triggered / triggered but Firecrawl not installed}

## Health summary

| Metric | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Sitemap URLs (Mode-1) | {n} | — |
| Discovered URLs (Mode-2, if ran) | {n} | — |
| Crawled/indexed URLs (200, indexable) | {n} | — |
| Missing from sitemap (probable adds) | {n} | {🔴 if >5%} |
| Orphans from sitemap (probable cuts or link-ins) | {n} | {🟡 if >5} |
| Broken sitemap entries (non-200) | {n} | {🔴 if >0} |
| Lastmod issues | {n} | {🟡 if uniform; 🔴 if stale} |

## Recommended changes

### Add to sitemap ({n} URLs)
- {URL} — indexed in GSC / fetched at status 200, indexable, but absent from sitemap.
- ...

### Remove from sitemap ({n} URLs)
- {URL} — returns {status code}.
- ...

### Investigate (orphan from sitemap, {n} URLs)
- {URL} — in sitemap but not reachable via internal links. Either link from {suggested parent} or remove from sitemap.
- ...

### Fix lastmod ({n} URLs)
- {URL} — lastmod is {date} but GSC last crawled the page on {date} and the page changed since.
- ...

## Validation

- Total URL count: {n} ({✓ under 50k limit | ✗ exceeds — split into sitemap-of-sitemaps})
- Referenced in robots.txt: {✓/✗}
- HTTPS consistency: {✓/✗}
- Encoding: {✓/✗}

## Apply
- See `recommended-sitemap-diff.md` for the proposed sitemap.xml changes.
- After applying, re-run `seo-technical-audit` to refresh the On-Page crawl baseline, then re-run this skill to verify.
```

## Tips

- Run `seo-technical-audit` first to reuse its On-Page crawl baseline, or let this skill build its own from GSC indexed pages + the On-Page fetch loop.
- Re-run after deploys that change page inventory (new content, removed pages, URL restructures).
- Sitemap-of-sitemaps fan-out can be large for big sites — the skill recursively fetches all child sitemaps. For sites with 50+ child sitemaps, fetching dominates runtime; not credit cost.
- `<priority>` and `<changefreq>` are dead signals — Google explicitly ignores both. Don't waste time tuning them; if your sitemap generator emits them, the bytes are pure overhead. `<lastmod>` is still consumed, so keep that one accurate.
- The "investigate orphans" list is often the highest-leverage finding — pages that exist but aren't linked are usually accidentally orphaned, and adding a couple of internal links can revive them.
- Pair with `seo-drift` to track sitemap composition over time (URL count, lastmod patterns).
- Cost: GSC indexed-pages reads are free; reusing `seo-technical-audit`'s already-fetched On-Page results avoids re-fetching. The DataForSEO `on_page_instant_pages` loop and `dataforseo_labs_google_relevant_pages` call bill per call — cap the loop to the top-N ceiling and cap the relevant-pages call with `limit`. Mode-2 adds Firecrawl credits at ~0.5 per discovered URL — surface the estimate before triggering.
