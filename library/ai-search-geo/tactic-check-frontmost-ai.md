# Tactic check

Many people sell tactics for AI search. Some tactics break a platform's rules, and the business carries the risk. Some have no evidence, and the business carries the cost.

Use this guidance to check a tactic before the person pays for it or does it.

## 1. List the tactics

Read the proposal, the pitch, or the plan. Write one line for each tactic: what is done, on which site, by whom, and at what cost.

If a line is not clear enough to check, write the question that makes it clear. Do not guess what the seller means.

## 2. Give each tactic one result

| Result | Rule |
|---|---|
| Against a rule | A platform's own published rule, or a law, forbids it. Quote the rule and link it |
| Does not do what is claimed | The platform's own documents say that the tactic has a different effect |
| Unproven | No rule forbids it. No platform document and no public test shows that it works |
| Reasonable | A platform's own guidance supports it, or it helps the people who read the page |

Some tactics depend on a condition. Give one result for each condition. A paid placement is reasonable when the page says that it is paid, and against a rule when the page hides it.

Start with [tactics.md](references/tactics.md). It holds the results for the usual tactics, with the official sources.

## 3. Check the source today

Rules change. Before you quote a rule, open its official page. If you cannot open it, write "not checked today" next to the result.

Use only these as a source for the result Against a rule: the platform's own policy page, or a regulator's page. A blog post or a video is not a source for it.

## 4. Check the promised results

- **A promise of mentions or of a place in ChatGPT.** Nobody outside an AI company controls its answers. No method is proven to earn a mention. Give a promise the result Unproven.
- **A number for how often people ask AI apps a question.** The AI companies do not publish these numbers. Ask where the number comes from.
- **A before-and-after result.** Ask five things: which questions, how many answers for each question, which dates, which AI app, and what stayed unchanged for comparison. One answer before and one answer after show nothing.

## 5. Write the questions for the seller

For each tactic that is unproven or that does not do what is claimed, write the questions that fit, for the person to send:

- "Which platform rule or document supports this?"
- "How did you measure the result, and can I see the answers?"
- "Who owns the accounts, the pages, and the listings after the contract ends?"
- "Does a page that you pay for say that it is paid?"

## Rules

- Give a result only with its reason. A result with no source is your opinion. Say so.
- This is not legal advice. For a question about the law, the person asks a lawyer.
- Laws differ by country. The reference file names United States rules. Say which country a rule covers.
- The decision is the person's. Report the risk and the cost. Do not decide for them.
- If the person already did a tactic that is against a rule, say how to undo it. Do not judge.

## Output

A table with one row for each tactic: the tactic, the result, the reason, the source, and what to do in its place.

Then three lines:

1. The tactics that are against a rule, with the risk of each one.
2. The total cost of the tactics that are unproven or that do not do what is claimed.
3. The questions for the seller.
