# better-seo

Two jobs, one skill: make a page **findable by crawlers** and **quotable by models**.

## Order of operations

1. **Fix the scan** before touching content. A page that is not crawlable or not parseable scores zero with every engine, human or machine.
2. **Then on-page**. Title, description, H1, headings, canonical, schema.
3. **Then agentic-search surface**. Answer-first structure, extractable claims, `llms.txt`, citable entity data.
4. **Then distribution**. Internal links, sitemap, feed, `robots.txt` AI-crawler policy.

Never optimize item 3 while item 1 is broken. Report the real blocker first.

## Run the audit before advising

Do not guess a site's state. Fetch it.

The CLI ships inside this skill folder. Run it from the skill directory (the
path where this `SKILL.md` lives), not from the user's project root:

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/audit.py https://example.com
python <skill-dir>/scripts/audit.py https://example.com --json out.json
python <skill-dir>/scripts/audit.py --fixture page.html    # offline, no network
python <skill-dir>/scripts/audit.py https://example.com --insecure  # TLS-intercepting proxy only
```

Copy `--json out.json` output somewhere the user can keep; do not write into the
skill directory.

Output: JSON with `url`, `score` (0-100), `checks` (each with `id`, `weight`,
`status`, `detail`), and `issues` (fail and warn lines, heaviest first). Read
`score` and every `fail` check before writing advice.

### Many pages at once

One page is not the site. When the user asks about the site as a whole, or wants
to know which problem is systemic, use the crawler in the same folder:

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/crawl.py https://example.com
python <skill-dir>/scripts/crawl.py https://example.com --source sitemap --limit 50
python <skill-dir>/scripts/crawl.py https://example.com --source links --depth 2
python <skill-dir>/scripts/crawl.py --fixture-dir dist/        # offline
```

It discovers URLs from `robots.txt` `Sitemap:` directives, then `/sitemap.xml`,
then same-origin links, and audits up to `--limit` pages. Defaults are timid on
purpose: one request at a time, 0.3s apart, 25 pages, hard cap 200. It honours
`robots.txt` before fetching anything, refuses off-origin URLs, and never writes
outside the `--json` path you give it.

Report `common_failures` first. A check failing on 31 of 50 pages is a template
bug and is worth more than any single page score. `worst` is the handful to look
at individually. Give `score_median`, not just the mean, because one broken page
must not hide a healthy site.
Fix checks in descending weight order; a 12-weight fail matters more than five 4-weight fails.

If the script cannot run, fall back to manual parsing and say so explicitly.
Never present unaudited advice as audited.

## Reference files

Load only what the task needs:

- `references/agentic-search.md` — AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity citation mechanics, `llms.txt`, answer-first writing, entity grounding. Read when the user's problem is "AI does not mention us".
- `references/onpage.md` — title/description/heading/schema rules with concrete numbers and templates.
- `references/technical.md` — crawl, index, canonical, robots, sitemap, JS rendering, Core Web Vitals thresholds.

## Answer shape

Lead with the blocker and the score. Then a ranked fix list: what, why it costs
visibility, exact replacement text or markup. No generic SEO essays. If a
recommendation cannot be verified from the fetched page, mark it as unverified
instead of asserting it.

## Guardrails

- Never invent metrics, rankings, traffic, or competitor data. If the user
  supplies analytics, cite them; otherwise state the data is missing.
- Never promise a ranking or a citation.
- Never recommend cloaking, doorway pages, hidden text, link schemes, or
  `llms.txt` content that contradicts the human-facing page.
- Time-sensitive claims (AI crawler user-agents, engine behavior) are marked as
  needing a live check rather than stated as permanent fact.

## Verification before handoff

- `python <skill-dir>/scripts/audit.py --fixture <page>` exits 0 and the reported score
  moved in the intended direction after the edit.
- Every rewrite you hand over is copy-paste ready and inside the stated limits.
