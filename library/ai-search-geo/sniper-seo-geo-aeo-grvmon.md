# SEO, GEO, and AEO audit & ranking engine

Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode use standard Google Search ranking systems. There is no secret file, schema type, or word count required to appear in them; pages must rank organically, satisfy search intent, and provide high Information Gain to be cited. Other answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) publish and maintain their own crawlers. Record what you fetched, score only tested facts, and leave everything else as `NT` (not tested).

Read `references/platforms.md` for crawlers and Core Web Vitals, `references/schema.md` when reviewing or generating structured data, `references/verticals.md` for page types, and `references/humanize.md` for content humanization and anti-AI cadence. A complete worked audit is in `references/example-audit.md`. A step-by-step tutorial is in `TUTORIAL.md`. A site-specific house rules template is in `references/house-rules-template.md`.

## Retired claims

Do not reuse these. They were stated in older marketing literature without a dated primary source: an 11% cross-engine citation overlap, "92% of AI Overview citations come from the top 10", "48% of ChatGPT citations are Wikipedia-class domains", a 3× table-extraction rate, a required 40–55 word answer, an information-gain patent penalty, a 5-second dwell rule, and a required 2,000-word guide. A hypothesis is allowed only when the ledger names a dated document. Otherwise delete the claim.

## 1. Intake & SERP intent

Stop and fill this in before recommending changes. Use `NT` for unknown fields.

| Field | What to record |
| --- | --- |
| **URL** | The canonical URL under audit |
| **Market** | Country, language, primary geographic target |
| **Target query** | Primary keyword query and secondary query variants |
| **SERP intent format** | One of: Informational Guide, Comparison Table, Interactive Calculator/Tool, Commercial Landing Page, Local Service. Verify whether page format matches what Google ranks on Page 1. |
| **Competitors** | URLs the owner names. Do not invent a set |
| **Access** | Which of these you can open: public URL, rendered HTML, Search Console, Bing Webmaster, analytics, logs |
| **Baseline** | Current index status, queries, impressions, clicks, conversions. `NT` if tool access is closed |
| **Training crawlers** | Owner choice per bot: `allow`, `disallow`, or `undecided`. Default is `undecided` |
| **Corrections policy** | URL of a visible corrections page, or `NT` |

## 2. Verify

Run the verification check with `bash` and the skill's absolute path, from any working directory. Use optional `-g` or `--googlebot` to emulate the official Googlebot Smartphone User-Agent:

```bash
# Standard verification:
bash <skill-dir>/scripts/verify-page.sh 'https://example.com/page/'
# Structured JSON output:
bash <skill-dir>/scripts/verify-page.sh -j 'https://example.com/page/'
# Executive Markdown summary report:
bash <skill-dir>/scripts/verify-page.sh -r 'https://example.com/page/'
# Emulate Googlebot Smartphone User-Agent:
bash <skill-dir>/scripts/verify-page.sh -g 'https://example.com/page/'
```

Exit 0 means a response was saved, even a 404. Exit 2 means usage error, missing `curl`/`python3`, or a failed fetch. The script reports pass/fail facts and prints `nt` for anything it did not do. It is an indexation and on-page validator, not a rank checker.

The script prints a `robots_agent:` line for 23 crawler tokens (job class, group used, `allow` or `disallow`). `group=*` means the token has no group of its own and falls back to `User-agent: *`; record that as an implicit choice, not an explicit one. Rules are matched against path plus query string. Known limits: directive typos that Google tolerates (`useragent`, `dissallow`) are not recognised, and a robots.txt that returns 5xx is reported `nt`.

Then evaluate these checks. Each is `pass`, `fail`, or `NT`.

0. **HTTP status and redirects.** `http_check: pass` requires a 2xx final response. Report `hop_status`. More than one redirect, or a 302/307 on a permanent URL, is a finding. A 404, 410, or other non-2xx page is `fail` and not indexable. A 401, 403, 429, or 5xx is `NT` (`index_note`): it may only block this user agent, so confirm with Search Console URL Inspection.
1. **Rendered HTML.** The script reads the initial HTTP body (`browser_render: nt`). If that body contains the main text, you may audit it and still mark the browser render `NT`. `js_shell_suspect: yes` (under 500 visible characters with scripts present) is a lead, not a verdict. If the body is a JavaScript shell, content scores stay `NT` until you compare URL Inspection or a rendered DOM.
2. **robots.txt, meta robots, and `X-Robots-Tag`.** Only the final response's headers count. `robots`, `googlebot`, and `bingbot` meta tags and bot-scoped headers for those bots are judged; other bots are listed as `*_other_agent` and not judged. `noindex` or `none` is `fail` when the URL should be indexed. A missing `index, follow` meta is `pass`: Google's default is `all`, and an explicit tag has no extra effect ([robots meta tag](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag), updated 2026-03-24). The more restrictive rule wins when both the header and the meta tag are set.
3. **Canonical.** No canonical prints `canonical_status: warn`. Otherwise one absolute HTTPS URL (`canonical_unique_count: 1`; repeated identical tags are fine), fetched without an error, and intentional if it differs from the final URL. `canonical_differs` names the difference: `query`, `trailing_slash`, `path`, or `scheme_or_host`.
4. **Sitemap.** The URL is in a sitemap declared from `robots.txt`. The script reads declared sitemaps, expands indexes, and unzips `.gz`, up to 20 files. Membership is `NT` when any file failed or the cap was hit.
5. **Schema.** JSON-LD parses without syntax errors. Every value is visible on the page and true. `schema_duplicate_types` flags duplicate root entities declared across separate blocks. `sameAs` URLs were opened and name the same entity. See `references/schema.md`.
6. **Title, meta & OpenGraph snippet health.** `title_status` checks length (30–65 chars optimal for Google SERP display without truncation). `meta_description_status` checks length (70–160 chars optimal). The script extracts `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` and verifies `og_title_matches_title`.
7. **Heading hierarchy & outline.** `h1_status` checks for a single descriptive H1 tag. `heading_hierarchy` audits `<h1-h6>` tags across the DOM to detect missing H1s, multiple H1s, or skipped heading levels (e.g. `h1->h3`).
8. **Mobile-first & viewport.** Google indexes the mobile version of a page. `viewport_status` checks for `width=device-width` in the viewport meta tag. A missing tag is a mobile usability risk; it is not a documented ranking penalty.
9. **Soft 404 detection.** `soft_404_suspect` flags 200 OK pages containing "not found / error" text or thin content (< 25 words). Google describes soft 404s as error-like pages served with a 200; this check is a heuristic lead and can false-positive on stubs, so confirm in URL Inspection.
10. **Direct answer passage readiness.** `first_p_words` and `first_p_answer_ready` evaluate whether the lead paragraph provides a self-contained 35–65 word passage suitable for Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT citation summaries.
11. **Content humanization & anti-AI cadence.** `humanize_status` scans visible text for formulaic AI clichés (*"in today's digital landscape"*, *"delve into"*, *"tapestry"*, *"testament to"*, *"pivotal role"*) so a human can edit them. This is a style lint, not a ranking test: Google does not document a filter for these phrases, and a hit is a prompt to review the sentence, not a failure. The script checks every phrase in `references/humanize.md` except the stacked-connector row, which needs paragraph context.
12. **Image SEO & optimization.** The script reports `img_count`, `img_missing_alt`, `img_lazy_count`, `img_missing_dims`, `img_dim_status`, `img_modern_formats`, `img_legacy_formats`, `img_format_status`, and `img_oversized_count`. Images should include descriptive alt text, explicit width and height dimensions or CSS aspect ratios to eliminate layout shifts (CLS), modern formats (WebP, AVIF, or SVG), and optimized file sizes (< 200 KB).
13. **Crawl caching & freshness.** Reports `last_modified` and `etag` headers used by Googlebot for conditional HTTP 304 crawl budget savings.
14. **Internal links and orphans.** Count same-host links on the page. An orphan is a sitemap URL with no internal link from the crawled set. Without that crawl, orphan status is `NT`.

A site's own house style, if any, lives in a separate reference file and is applied only to that site. See `references/house-rules-template.md`.

Crawler classes and owner decisions for training bots are in `references/platforms.md`. `llms.txt` is optional. Google Search ignores it and it does not change Google rankings ([AI optimization guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide); updates log 2026-06-15). If one exists, its claims must also be visible on the site. The script detects SPA/catch-all servers serving HTML on `/llms.txt` and reports `soft_404`.

### Direct answer blocks

On an informational guide or question page, place a standalone answer block directly under the title or byline: it should make complete sense if quoted alone.

- Do not start that paragraph with a plain-text label such as `Direct answer:`, `Summary:`, or `TL;DR:`. A visually styled eyebrow (for example a `<strong>` badge with no colon) is fine. The script reports `first_p_label_prefix`.
- In `QAPage` or `FAQPage` JSON-LD, `acceptedAnswer.text` and `suggestedAnswer.text` must be clean prose with no label prefix, including the eyebrow text. The script reports `schema_answer_label_prefix` (count of labelled answers). The text must match what is visible on the page.

## 3. Experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trust & Information Gain

Google's helpful-content guidance asks whether a page shows first-hand experience, expertise, and original value rather than a rewrite of existing results ([helpful content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content)). E-E-A-T is a quality framework, not a single ranking factor, and "Information Gain" here is this skill's own heuristic, not a documented Google signal. Treat the scores below as a review aid.

Judge five visible attributes:

- **First-hand experience & Information Gain.** The page presents original research, proprietary datasets, hands-on testing photos/observations, or unique tools absent from competitor SERP results.
- **Natural human cadence & burstiness.** Zero robotic AI clichés. Vary sentence length (mix short 4-word declarations with analytical sentences), use active voice, and maintain high fact-to-token density. See `references/humanize.md`.
- **Author entity & expertise.** A visible byline with credentials linking to an author profile page with verifiable external entity profiles (`sameAs` with LinkedIn, GitHub, ORCID, or official directory).
- **Qualified review.** Legal, tax, engineering, or medical claims cite a qualified reviewer, or the page carries a prominent disclaimer stating it is not professional advice.
- **Primary source evidence.** Numerical figures, dates, prices, or statutory citations link directly to primary institutional or government documents. Paraphrasing third-party summaries is penalised.
- **Corrections & editorial policy.** YMYL pages link to a visible corrections policy or show a dated changelog.
- **Verifiable self-description.** Replace vague marketing superlatives ("unbiased", "best", "most trusted", "#1") with checkable wording: what the methodology is, who is registered or qualified, and what the reader can inspect.

## 4. Score

Two distinct outputs. Do not blend them into an arbitrary composite score.

**Technical checks** stay `pass` / `fail` / `NT` from section 2.

**Citability** is five categories. Each tested category is an integer `0–10` or `NT`. Weights sum to 100.

| Id | Weight | Points | Evaluation criteria |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **answer** | 30 | `floor(10 × hits / n + 0.5)` | First `n` H2s in order, `n = min(8, count)`. No H2s: use the block under the H1 and `n = 1`. A hit: the first sentence states the heading's conclusion. |
| **contain** | 20 | `floor(10 × passes / n + 0.5)` | First 8 paragraphs of at least 20 words. `n` is sample size. A pass: the first sentence does not use unresolved pronouns (*it, this, they, these, those, we, our, I*) unless that paragraph explicitly names the referent. |
| **structure** | 20 | Start at 10, floor at 0 | Heading hierarchy. Subtract 4 if H1 count is not 1. Subtract 2 if a heading level is skipped. Subtract 2 if a multi-item comparison lacks an HTML table or list. Subtract 2 if a multi-step sequence is written as dense prose without an ordered list. |
| **sourced** | 15 | `NT` if no claims; else `floor(10 × sourced / n + 0.5)` | Up to 8 claims stating a number, date, price, benchmark, or statute. Sourced means a primary document name, statute, or URL sits adjacent to the claim. |
| **original** | 15 | 10, 5, or 0 | **10 (High Information Gain):** original data, proprietary calculation, benchmark, or first-hand observation absent from competitor pages. **5:** original worked example using a standard method. **0:** regurgitation of existing search results. |

`answer` and `contain` are rater-judged proxies, and `original` is a judgment against opened competitor pages. Scores are comparable across runs only when the same method is used. `NT` if that evidence was not collected. `original` is `NT` when competitor URLs were not opened. Do not turn `NT` into 0.

```
raw = sum(points / 10 × weight) for tested categories
coverage = sum(weight) for tested categories
overall = floor(100 × raw / coverage + 0.5) if coverage ≥ 60 else NT
```

`coverage` is how much of the rubric you tested, not a quality score. Report every category as `points/10` or `NT`, plus `coverage` and `overall`.

## 5. Evidence ledger

Every number, fact, and claim in the report must map to a ledger row. No row, no number.

| Id | Claim | Evidence | Source | Retrieved | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | One sentence | What you saw, and where | Document or URL | YYYY-MM-DD | `verified`, `hypothesis`, or `nt` |

`hypothesis` requires a named document and a date. A row without both is dropped, not guessed.

## 6. Measure

Track real search engine and answer engine performance over time without inventing a lift.

- **Google Search Console.** Performance Web report captures overall impressions, clicks, CTR, and average position (including AI Overviews). The Generative AI performance report splits out dedicated AI referrals. `NT` without access.
- **Bing Webmaster Tools.** Track Bingbot indexation, click performance, and Copilot discovery. `NT` without access.
- **Conversions.** Track one defined business conversion (form submission, tool interaction, signup, purchase).
- **AI Referrals.** Monitor web analytics referral sessions from `chatgpt.com`, `perplexity.ai`, `gemini.google.com`, and `copilot.microsoft.com`. Note that stripped HTTP referrers undercount.
- **Citation Sampling.** Maintain a frozen query list, engine set, and locale. Record whether the page URL is cited as a source link across weekly runs.
