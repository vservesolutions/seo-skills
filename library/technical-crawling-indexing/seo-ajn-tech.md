# SEO: audit, fix, verify

This is an engineering skill, not a checklist generator. It turns an SEO request into
evidence, a prioritised fix list, implemented changes, and a verification pass. It was
built from a real multilingual audit and implementation (see `docs/CASE-STUDY-AJENU.md`).

## When to use

Use it when the user asks to audit a site, explain why pages are not ranking or
indexing, fix crawlability or metadata, add localized versions and hreflang, add
structured data or social previews, improve Core Web Vitals, write robots.txt /
sitemap / llms.txt, decide how AI crawlers should be treated, or set up Search Console
measurement.

Do **not** use it to promise rankings, buy links, cloak content, mass-publish
near-duplicate pages, invent reviews/statistics, or advise on paid ads. Say so plainly
and stop at the boundary.

## Prime directives

1. **Evidence first.** Every finding needs a URL, a status code, a header, a tag, or a
   quoted snippet. Never report "probably slow" or "likely duplicate" without a check.
2. **Never fabricate.** No invented client names, testimonials, prices, statistics,
   certifications, integrations or examples. If the audit asks for real customer proof,
   state that only the site owner can supply it.
3. **Separate what the repo can fix from what only the host can fix.** Compression,
   cache TTLs, CDN redirects and DNS are hosting tasks. Do not claim them as done when
   you only wrote code. Record the owner per finding: `code`, `content`, `server`,
   `external` (Search Console, DNS, third-party).
4. **Do not write meta tags to a character limit.** Titles must be accurate and unique;
   descriptions useful. Google rewrites snippets, so length is a craft guideline, not a
   publish gate.
5. **robots.txt controls crawling, not indexing.** To remove a page from search use
   `noindex` (or remove the page). `Disallow` alone can leave URL-only listings.
6. **Measure, then state caveats.** Lab tools (PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse) and field
   data (CrUX, Search Console) disagree. Never invent a CWV score. If you could not
   measure, say which tool or credential was missing.
7. **Verify the finished work.** A fix list is not done until the rebuilt site passes a
   repeatable check (crawl all URLs, validate crawl files, re-run headers).

## Quick start

From this skill's directory (resolve it from the SKILL.md path your harness gave you):

```bash
# Audit a live site, a sitemap, or a local build directory.
node scripts/seo-audit.mjs audit https://example.com --json --out seo-report.json
node scripts/seo-audit.mjs audit ./dist --base https://example.com
node scripts/seo-audit.mjs page https://example.com/pricing
node scripts/seo-audit.mjs crawl-files https://example.com

# CI gate: exit non-zero if a critical or high finding exists.
node scripts/seo-audit.mjs audit ./dist --base https://example.com --fail-on high
```

The audit is dependency-free and read-only. It fetches politely (one page at a time,
bounded by `--max-pages`), accepts an input limit, and never submits forms or changes
state. If Node is unavailable, follow `references/audit-checklist.md` manually.

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Scope and baseline

- Confirm the canonical host, the languages/markets that matter, and the business goal.
- Record the starting state: sitemap URL count, robots status, indexing tools
  available, analytics/Search Console access, last known Core Web Vitals.
- Ask for credentials or access only when the task genuinely needs them (Search
  Console, analytics, DNS). Otherwise mark the check as `not verifiable` and move on.

### Phase 1 — Inventory and crawl

- Find every public URL: sitemap(s), internal links, and a crawl of the homepage.
- For each page capture: status, indexability, title, description, canonical, `lang`,
  H1 count, structured data, Open Graph, hreflang, internal links, main-content word
  count, and rendered vs raw content differences.
- Flag duplicates by title, description, and normalized main-content n-grams.

### Phase 2 — Technical foundations

Fix in this order because everything else depends on it:

1. Status codes and redirects: no 5xx, no chains, no redirect loops; one canonical host
   (apex vs `www`) with a permanent 301 to the other.
2. Indexability: no accidental `noindex`, no `Disallow` on public paths, no soft 404s.
3. Canonicalisation: self-referencing absolute canonical on every indexable page; one
   URL per piece of content.
4. Sitemap: XML-valid, only canonical 200 URLs, hreflang alternates when localized,
   listed in robots.txt.
5. robots.txt: valid groups, explicit sitemap, a documented AI-crawler policy.
6. URL hygiene: trailing slashes consistent, `index.html` redirects, lowercase slugs,
   no parameters that duplicate content.

See `references/technical-seo.md` and `references/crawl-files.md`.

### Phase 3 — Internationalisation

A language must be a real URL, not a client-side text swap:

- Default language at the root, others under `/<lang>/` (or a consistent subdomain
  scheme). Server-render the translated text, title, description and canonical.
- Every localized page carries reciprocal `hreflang` for every version **plus
  `x-default`**, each pointing at the same content set.
- The sitemap repeats the alternates; the canonical stays self-referencing.
- `lang` matches the page language; `og:locale` and alternates are set.
- Translate search-relevant terms, not only navigation; keep terminology consistent.
- Legacy `?lang=` links should 301/redirect to the localized path; do not rely on
  `localStorage` or device-language redirects for crawlers.

See `references/internationalization.md`.

### Phase 4 — Content quality

Word count is not a ranking target; intent satisfaction is. For each priority page make
sure the reader can answer: who is this for, what exactly do I get, what does setup
involve, what happens next, what does it cost or depend on, and what proof exists.
Add FAQs only when they are real questions. Never publish 37 near-identical pages to
target keywords. See `references/content-quality.md`.

### Phase 5 — Structured data and social previews

- JSON-LD: `Organization` + `WebSite` + `WebPage` site-wide; add `Service`,
  `BreadcrumbList`, `FAQPage`, `Article`, `Product` only where they describe the page.
- Validate JSON parses and that visible content matches the schema (for example FAQ
  questions and answers). Localized pages must declare `inLanguage` and localized
  text.
- `og:image` must be a real 1200×630 (or 1.91:1) asset per page type; set
  `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:locale` (+ alternates), and a
  `twitter:card`. Missing images are a sharing loss, not a ranking penalty.

See `references/structured-data.md`.

### Phase 6 — Performance and Core Web Vitals

Work from measurements, not guesses:

- Remove render-blocking CSS/JS from the critical path (inline critical CSS, defer
  scripts, avoid chained requests). Prefer minified, self-hosted or inlined assets.
- Serve responsive images with `srcset`/`sizes`, correct `width`/`height`, modern
  formats, and `fetchpriority="high"` only on the LCP image.
- Enable compression (brotli/gzip) and long cache lifetimes for versioned assets on the
  server/CDN; HTML should revalidate.
- Set fonts to not block first render (`preload` + `noscript` or self-host).
- Measure mobile and desktop separately; report LCP, INP, CLS with tool and date.

Server headers and cache TTLs are `server`-owned findings. Document the exact
directives (nginx/Apache/Caddy/CDN) instead of pretending a repo change fixed them.
See `references/performance.md`.

### Phase 7 — AI search and crawler policy

Decide **separately** whether AI search/answer crawlers may crawl (usually yes, so the
site can be cited) and whether model-training crawlers may crawl (a publishing
decision). Encode the decision in robots.txt with explicit user-agent groups; explain in
the report that this is not access control and does not remove pages from search.

`llms.txt` is a small, maintained summary for AI tools: what the site does, who it
serves, and links to accurate public pages. It is not a replacement for the HTML, the
sitemap, or structured data. See `references/ai-search.md` and
`references/crawl-files.md`.

### Phase 8 — Measurement and reporting

Deliver a report with:

1. Scope, date, and what could not be measured.
2. A findings table sorted by severity (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) with
   evidence, why it matters, fix, owner, and how to validate.
3. A prioritised implementation plan (the first three fixes, not fifty).
4. Verification results after implementation: crawl counts, status codes, hreflang
   reciprocity, crawl-file validity, headers.
5. External follow-ups: Search Console property + sitemap submission, URL inspection,
   PageSpeed/CrUX, DNS, content only the client can supply.

Use `references/report-template.md`.

## Guardrails

- No cloaking, doorway pages, paid links, link farms, PBNs, snippet manipulation.
- No fake reviews, ratings, statistics, certifications, or "trusted by" logos.
- No keyword stuffing in titles, headings, alt text, or schema.
- No auto-redirect based on the visitor's device language that hides the canonical
  localized page from crawlers; offer a switcher instead.
- No `Disallow` for pages that must stay indexable; no `noindex` on pages you need.
- Do not present Lighthouse lab estimates as field Core Web Vitals.
- If a requested tactic would harm users or violate search policies, refuse that tactic
  and offer the compliant alternative.

## Scripts

`scripts/seo-audit.mjs` — read-only auditor. Supports live URLs and local build
directories. `--json` for agents/CI, `--out` to write a report, `--fail-on` for CI.
Findings include `severity`, `area`, `page`, `evidence`, `fix`, `owner`, and a
`validation` hint. Use `node scripts/seo-audit.mjs --help` for all options.

If a required check depends on credentials or a browser you do not have, say so in the
report instead of skipping silently.
