# Web performance without visible change

Every page view costs requests and bytes, and on Vercel Pro requests are what a team runs out of
first. The aim: the same design, fewer requests, fewer bytes, faster first paint.

**Trade-off rule:** changes nobody can see (caching, formats, lazy loading, chunking) can just be
done. Changes people could notice (softer video, fewer animations, a missing feature) need the
person's decision: name the saving and the visible cost.

## Steps

1. **Measure first** on a deployment (local preview servers don't compress):

   ```bash
   BASE=https://<deployment> PAGES=/,/services/x/ node <skill>/scripts/measure-requests.cjs
   ```

   It reports requests and KB for a first visit and the next page, desktop and phone, by type,
   plus redirects, 404s and other hosts. How to read it:
   [references/measuring.md](references/measuring.md).
2. **Fix the biggest cost first**, usually in this order:
   - **Caching headers** so shared files load once per visitor (`vercel-static-config`).
   - **Video**: short loops, `preload="none"`, loaded near the viewport, phone copies:
     [references/video.md](references/video.md).
   - **Images**: AVIF/WebP at 2–4 widths, correct `sizes`, lazy below the fold.
   - **Fonts**: 2–3 self-hosted variable WOFF2 files.
   - **Requests that repeat**: inline logo, `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, no links through
     redirects, no 404s.
   - **JavaScript**: heavy code in lazy chunks; below-the-fold animation set up in idle time.

   Details: [references/images-fonts-js.md](references/images-fonts-js.md).
3. **Measure again** and compare requests and bytes per page.
4. **Look at it:** every page you touched at 320, 390, 768, 1024 and 1440 px; video `currentSrc`
   at phone sizes; cards at 3× pixel density.
5. **Check real users after launch:** Core Web Vitals at the 75th percentile on mobile in Search
   Console (CrUX): LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1. Lighthouse can't measure INP (it reports
   TBT instead).

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `measure-requests.cjs` | Requests and bytes per view as the CDN sees them (Playwright, Chromium) |
| `phone-videos.mjs` | Phone copies of background videos: whole frame for small cards, an upright crop for tall sections (ffmpeg). Edit the settings block at the top |
| `icons.mjs` | Inline SVG logo `<symbol>`, `favicon.ico` (16/32/48) and `apple-touch-icon.png` (180) from the SVG logo (sharp). Edit the settings block at the top |

## Common wins

| Change | Typical effect |
|---|---|
| Phone copies of background videos | Phone home page 12.2 → 7.0 MB on the source project |
| Inline logo symbol instead of light and dark logo files | 2 requests fewer per first visit |
| `favicon.ico` + `apple-touch-icon.png` present | Repeating, uncached 404s gone |
| Animation setup moved to idle time | Mobile lab TBT 1,260 → 100 ms, same visuals |
| Long cache on hashed files and fonts | Next page: 1 request instead of 10+ |
