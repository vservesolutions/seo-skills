# Technical SEO audit

Finds the mechanical problems that keep pages out of search or split their signals. It does not
judge content quality or keywords (see `seo-metadata`), structured-data details (see
`structured-data`) or speed (see `web-performance`).

## Steps

1. **Build the site** (`npm run build` or the project's command). The audit reads the output
   folder: `dist/`, `out/`, `build/` or `public/`.
2. **Run the audit** from the project root:

   ```bash
   node <skill>/scripts/seo-audit.mjs --dir dist --site https://www.example.com
   ```

   - `--site` is the production origin. Without it, the home page's canonical is used.
   - On a live site: `--sitemap https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml` fetches every listed page;
     add `--check-links` to also request internal links that aren't in the sitemap.
   - `--json report.json` writes every finding; `--strict` also fails on warnings.
3. **Read the report.** Findings are grouped by check id. Errors keep pages out of search or break
   something; warnings cost ranking, clicks or requests. Look up each id in
   [references/checks.md](references/checks.md) for why it matters and how to fix it.
4. **Fix at the source,** never in the build output: the page template, the content file, the
   generator script or the CMS. Then rebuild and run the audit again until no errors remain.
5. **Keep it in the build** so mistakes can't ship. In `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": { "postbuild": "node scripts/seo-audit.mjs --dir dist" }
   ```

   Copy `seo-audit.mjs`, `site-files.mjs` and `serp-width.mjs` into the project's `scripts/` for
   that. The exit code is 1 when there are errors, so the build stops.

## Reading the results

- **Zero findings on a mature site is normal.** On a new site, expect dozens: start with errors
  that repeat on every page (a template problem fixes many at once).
- **Warnings are judgement calls.** A title over 580 px is cut on desktop results but may still be
  right if the keyword comes first. A second `<h1>` is allowed by HTML but weakens the topic
  signal. Explain the trade-off rather than "fixing" blindly.
- **`canonical-other-page` is often intentional** (a print version, a filtered list). Confirm with
  the person before changing it.
- **Live mode can't see missing files** the way the build check can; run the build check too.

## What it checks

| Area | Checks |
|---|---|
| Head | `<html lang>`, viewport, title (present, unique, width), description (present, unique, width, length), canonical (present, absolute, same host, self or other page), robots `noindex`, Open Graph |
| Content | one non-empty `<h1>`, no skipped heading levels, images with `alt` and size, HTML under 2 MB |
| Links and files | internal links to pages that don't exist, links without the trailing slash, links to `/index.html`, scripts, styles, images, video and share images missing from the build |
| Languages | hreflang codes, absolute URLs, self link, `x-default`, the return link from every alternate |
| Structured data | every JSON-LD block parses and names schema.org (graph checks: `structured-data`) |
| Site files | `robots.txt` present, not blocking everything, naming the sitemap; `sitemap.xml` URLs exist, are on the site's host, end in the right slash, have valid `lastmod`; every indexable page listed; a `404.html` |

## Notes

- The parser reads HTML as written, so it sees what search engines see before JavaScript runs.
  Content that only appears after JavaScript is invisible to it (and partly to crawlers).
- Pixel widths come from `serp-width.mjs` (Arial metrics, 20 px titles, 14 px descriptions). Google
  has no length limit; results are cut to fit the device.
- `noindex` pages are left out of duplicate and sitemap checks; the 404 page is checked for
  existence only.
