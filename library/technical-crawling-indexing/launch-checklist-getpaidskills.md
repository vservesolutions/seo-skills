# launch-checklist

Run the automated audit, fix what fails in the code, re-run until clean, then walk through the
manual items the script cannot see. Report to the user what you changed and what still needs them.

## Step 1 — Run the audit

Against the production URL if it exists, otherwise a local production build
(`npm run build && npm start`, not the dev server — dev servers add scripts and skip caching):

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_site.py https://example.com            # text report
python3 scripts/audit_site.py http://localhost:3000 --max-pages 30 --json > audit.json
```

What it checks (details in `references/checks.md`):
- Per page: `<title>` (10–60 chars), meta description (50–160), exactly one `<h1>`, `<html lang>`,
  viewport, canonical (absolute, same host), og:title/description/image, twitter:card,
  `<img>` without `alt`, HTML size, response time, `noindex` on pages you probably want indexed,
  duplicate titles/descriptions across pages.
- Site: `/robots.txt` exists and does not `Disallow: /` everything, references a sitemap;
  `/sitemap.xml` (or the one named in robots) parses and its URLs return 200 on the same host;
  favicon reachable; apple-touch-icon; a random URL returns **404** (not 200 or a redirect to home);
  http→https redirect (for https sites); links to privacy policy / terms (and refund policy if
  the site sells something); `/llms.txt` presence (informational only).

Exit code 1 when any FAIL. Pages crawled: start URL + same-host links, up to `--max-pages` (default 20).

## Step 2 — Fix in the codebase

Detect the framework and use the matching recipe. For Next.js App Router,
`references/fixes-nextjs.md` has drop-in `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `not-found.tsx`, `metadata`,
icon conventions. Generic HTML/other frameworks: `references/fixes-generic.md`.

Rules:
- Fix the root cause (shared layout / metadata helper), not page by page, when the issue repeats.
- Never add `noindex` or block crawlers without asking.
- Missing legal pages: generate them with the `legal-pages` skill if installed; otherwise tell the
  user — do not invent legal text inline.
- Missing OG images: use the `og-image-kit` skill if installed.

## Step 3 — Re-run until no FAIL

Re-run the same command. WARN items: fix the cheap ones, list the rest for the user.

## Step 4 — Manual items (script cannot verify)

Go through `references/manual-checklist.md` with the user — analytics installed, error tracking,
transactional email deliverability (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), payment flow tested end-to-end with a real
small payment, backups, uptime monitor, Search Console / Bing Webmaster verification and sitemap
submission, status of the domain's renewal. Mark each as done / not applicable / user to do.

## Step 4b — Payment self-check (if the site takes money)

```bash
python3 scripts/payment_check.py --src . --provider creem          # code scan
python3 scripts/payment_check.py --url http://localhost:3000        # probes a running build
python3 scripts/payment_check.py --url http://localhost:3000 --secret "$CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET"  # test-mode secret only
```
FAILs: webhook accepts unsigned or forged requests, parses JSON before verifying, no dedupe on
event id, success page grants access, payment secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` or committed, webhook
redirects or sits behind a bot challenge. Fix them, re-run, then do the manual card tests in
`references/payment-checks.md` (success card, decline card, refund, dashboard resend, cancel).
Never pass a live webhook secret. `scripts/test_payment_check.py` is the script's own test.
Test, spec and fixture files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.tsx`, `test_*.py`, anything under `tests/`, `e2e/`,
`__tests__/`, `fixtures/`) are not judged as handlers or success pages, because they post unsigned
requests and insert rows on purpose; they are still scanned for committed live keys. The report says
how many were skipped (`INFO test files`).

## Report format

```
Launch audit for <url> — <date>
FAIL fixed: …   (file:line changed)
WARN fixed: …
Still open (needs you): …
Manual checklist: x/y done
```
