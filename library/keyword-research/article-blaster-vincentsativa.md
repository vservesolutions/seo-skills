# Article Blaster

Streamlined content creation pipeline. Takes existing research data and a user-provided topic/story angle, then produces a publication-ready article with SEO keywords and social media assets using a 5-agent swarm.

**Golden Rule: Never spawn more than 3 concurrent agents.** Ollama Pro allows only 3 concurrent model slots. Exceeding this causes queued agents to time out and crash the entire pipeline.

## Agent Model

All agents use `kimi-k2.6:cloud` with `reasoning_effort: low`.

## Pipeline Phases

### Phase 1: Input Setup

**Do NOT spawn agents for this phase.** The human operator (or manual process) provides:
- Research data file path(s) or directory (e.g., OpenClaw swarm report, IronPulse output, or any research document)
- Topic angle / story direction

**How Vinny discovers topics (important context):** Vinny typically surfaces article topics through interactive discussion of Ironpulse reports, not through pre-written briefs. He treats the Ironpulse output as an opening bid and uses conversation to find the patterns and angles worth writing about. By the time Article Blaster is invoked, the topic is already clear from that discussion. Don't suggest alternative topics or re-litigate the angle, blast what he gave you.

Save these as context variables for all subsequent agents.

**Critical: If the operator already provided file paths and a topic angle, proceed immediately to Phase 2. Do NOT manually pre-read the data files. That wastes time and defeats the purpose of a background pipeline. Let the synthesis agents read the files. Do NOT write orchestration scripts or helper scripts. Just call `delegate_task`.**

### Phase 2: Story Synthesis (2 agents, parallel)

Spawn 2 Synthesis Agents simultaneously via `delegate_task`. Both receive the same research data file path(s) and topic angle. Pass the file paths in the task instruction; let the agents read the files themselves.

**Synthesis Agent 1:**
- Read the research data file
- Analyze the data specifically for the story angle provided
- Propose an article thesis, structural outline, and key narrative beats
- Identify the strongest evidence/quotes/data points from the research
- Write a detailed synthesis document

**Synthesis Agent 2:**
- Read the research data file
- Analyze the data from a DIFFERENT angle or emphasis
- Propose an alternative article thesis, structural outline, and narrative approach
- Identify different evidence/data points that support this alternative angle
- Write a detailed synthesis document

**Output files:**
- `~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/synthesis-1-[slug].md`
- `~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/synthesis-2-[slug].md`

**WAIT for both synthesis agents to complete before proceeding.**

### Phase 3: Keyword Research (1 agent)

Spawn 1 Keywords Agent. It receives both synthesis documents.

**Keywords Agent:**
- Read both synthesis documents
- Research current SEO keyword opportunities related to the article topic
- Target keywords from Vinny's priority gap list when applicable
- Provide 5-7 high-value keyword targets with:
  - Search volume estimate
  - Competition level
  - Rationale for inclusion
  - Suggested usage in article (title, H2, body)
- Rank keywords by priority

**Output file:**
- `~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/keywords-[slug].md`

**WAIT for keyword agent to complete before proceeding.**

### Phase 4: Content Creation (2 agents, parallel)

Spawn 2 agents simultaneously. Both receive the synthesis documents and keyword research.

**Writer Agent:**
- Read synthesis documents and keyword research
- Write the FULL article draft following PhantomByte writing style (load `phantom-byte-writing-style` skill)
- **CRITICAL: NO EM DASHES** anywhere in the article. Use periods, commas, parentheses, or colons instead.
- Incorporate target SEO keywords naturally into title, headings, and body
- Follow the article format standard (see below)
- The article draft file must contain ONLY the article body. Do NOT append keywords, social posts, or any metadata to the article draft file. Do NOT add any footer with "Generated by ARTICLE-BLASTER" or QA status to the article draft.
- End the article cleanly after the final paragraph

**Social + QA Agent:**
- Read synthesis documents, keyword research, AND the completed article draft
- Create X.com post (engaging, shareable)
- Create LinkedIn post (professional, detailed)
- Create Pinterest post (SEO-friendly title + full summary description)
- Fact-check all claims in the article against the source research data
- Grammar and style review
- **CRITICAL: Check for em dashes** in the article draft. Flag every instance.
- Verify PhantomByte writing style compliance
- Produce a QA report with findings

**Output files:**
- `~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/[date]-[slug]-draft.md` (article ONLY, no metadata)
- `~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/[date]-[slug]-social.md` (social media assets)
- `~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/[date]-[slug]-qa.md` (QA report)

### Phase 4.5: Path Verification (CRITICAL)

**Before spawning Phase 4 agents, the orchestrator MUST:**
1. Confirm both synthesis files exist at exact paths
2. Confirm keywords file exists at exact path
3. Create a `paths.txt` manifest in the output directory with canonical paths

**After Writer Agent completes, before spawning Social+QA:**
1. Verify draft file exists at the exact expected path
2. If file not found, FAIL and report, do NOT search for alternatives
3. Update `paths.txt` with confirmed draft path

**Social+QA Agent reads `paths.txt` for all file locations, never hardcode or guess paths.**

### Phase 5: Delivery

Deliver ONLY file paths. **NEVER dump article content into Telegram.**

Format:
```
Draft: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\vincent\.hermes\workspace\article-drafts\[slug]\[date]-[slug]-draft.md
Social: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\vincent\.hermes\workspace\article-drafts\[slug]\[date]-[slug]-social.md
QA: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\vincent\.hermes\workspace\article-drafts\[slug]\[date]-[slug]-qa.md
```

## Article Format Standard (Reference: ARTICLE 39 - FIRST COMPLETE)

The article draft must follow this exact format:

```
[Title]

Written by: Vinny Barreca
[Date]

[Opening paragraph. First-person, visceral, personal. Hook the reader immediately. No bold on intro paragraph.]

[Body content with:]
- H2 headings for major sections (no --- separators between H2s, just the heading)
- H3 subheadings within sections
- Code blocks with language labels (e.g., ```python)
- Bold labels where appropriate
- Short, punchy sentence fragments for emphasis
- Tables for comparisons
- No bullet-point lists in body prose. Use flowing narrative paragraphs.

[Final section returns to opening problem with new context/understanding. Ends with a strong closing paragraph.]

--------------FOR PI--------DO NOT INCLUDE IN ARTICLE--------------

## RECOMMENDED KEYWORDS (5-7 High-Value Targets)

### 1. [keyword]
- **Search Volume:** [estimate]
- **Competition:** [level]
- **Fit:** [how it relates to the article]
- **Usage:** [where to place it]
- **Priority:** [star rating]

[Repeat for all 5-7 keywords]

---

## KEYWORD PLACEMENT STRATEGY

### Headline Options (incorporating priority keywords):
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]
3. [Option 3]

### Intro Paragraph (first 100 words):
- Include: [primary keywords]

### Body Sections:
- **Section 1 (Technical):** [keywords for this section]
- **Section 2 (Platform):** [keywords for this section]
- **Section 3 (Implications):** [keywords for this section]

### Conclusion:
- Reinforce: [keywords]
```

**Key formatting notes from reference article:**
- No `---` horizontal rules between sections (only H2 headings)
- `Written by: Vinny Barreca` on its own line, not bold
- Date on its own line below byline
- Code blocks use triple backticks with language label
- Keywords section separated by `--------------FOR PI--------DO NOT INCLUDE IN ARTICLE--------------`
- Keywords include full placement strategy (headline options, intro targets, body section assignments, conclusion reinforcement)

## Critical Rules

1. **NO EM DASHES** in any output. Not in articles. Not in social posts. Not anywhere. Use periods, commas, parentheses, or colons instead. The Social + QA Agent MUST flag every em dash found.

2. **Article draft format: Article body + keywords section.** The draft file contains the full article body, then `--------------FOR PI--------DO NOT INCLUDE IN ARTICLE--------------`, then the keyword/placement strategy section. Do NOT append social media assets, QA reports, "Generated by" stamps, or word count footers to the draft file.

3. **Max 3 concurrent agents.** Phase 2 spawns 2. Phase 3 spawns 1. Phase 4 spawns 2. Never more than 3 at once.

4. **Phase gates are mandatory.** Do not start Phase 3 until both Phase 2 agents complete. Do not start Phase 4 until Phase 3 agent completes.

5. **Telegram delivery = UNC file paths only.** NEVER paste article content into a Telegram message. Only send the file path.

6. **Fallback: If agents fail, generate via execute_code.** Always deliver something. Never return empty-handed.

7. **Load phantom-byte-writing-style skill.** The Writer Agent must follow Vinny's established voice and formatting conventions.

8. **Slug format:** lowercase, hyphenated, date-prefixed. Example: `2026-04-17-claude-design`

## Delegate Task Templates

### Synthesis Agent 1

```
You are a story synthesis agent. Read the research data at [DATA_PATH] and analyze it for the following story angle: [TOPIC_ANGLE].

Produce a detailed synthesis document that includes:
1. A clear article thesis statement
2. A structural outline with section headings
3. Key narrative beats and evidence supporting this angle
4. Specific data points, quotes, or findings from the research
5. A recommended opening hook

Save your output to: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/synthesis-1-[SLUG].md
```

### Synthesis Agent 2

```
You are a story synthesis agent. Read the research data at [DATA_PATH] and analyze it from a DIFFERENT angle than the obvious take on: [TOPIC_ANGLE].

Challenge conventional framing. Find a contrarian or underexplored angle. Produce a detailed synthesis document that includes:
1. An alternative article thesis statement
2. A structural outline with section headings
3. Key narrative beats and evidence supporting this alternative angle
4. Specific data points, quotes, or findings from the research
5. A recommended opening hook that surprises

Save your output to: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/synthesis-2-[SLUG].md
```

### Keywords Agent

```
You are an SEO keyword research agent. Read both synthesis documents:
- ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/synthesis-1-[SLUG].md
- ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/synthesis-2-[SLUG].md

Research and provide 5-7 high-value SEO keyword targets for an article on [TOPIC_ANGLE]. For each keyword provide:
- Search volume estimate
- Competition level
- Rationale for inclusion
- Suggested usage (title, H2, body)

Prioritize keywords from any known content gaps. Rank by priority.

Save your output to: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/keywords-[SLUG].md
```

### Writer Agent

```
You are a professional article writer. Write a publication-ready article draft following these inputs:
- Synthesis 1: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/synthesis-1-[SLUG].md
- Synthesis 2: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/synthesis-2-[SLUG].md
- Keywords: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/keywords-[SLUG].md

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NO EM DASHES. Use periods, commas, parentheses, or colons instead. Zero exceptions.
2. Write in PhantomByte style: first-person narrative, visceral opening, pragmatic and battle-tested tone, slightly irreverent.
3. Incorporate target SEO keywords naturally into title, headings, and body.
4. The article draft file must contain the article body followed by the keywords section separated by `--------------FOR PI--------DO NOT INCLUDE IN ARTICLE--------------`. Do NOT append social media assets, QA reports, or any "Generated by" footer. The keywords section must include full placement strategy (headline options, intro targets, body section assignments, conclusion reinforcement).
5. Follow the article format standard (see ARTICLE 39 reference). Use H2/H3 headings, code blocks with language labels, bold labels, tables. No horizontal rules between sections. No bullet-point lists in body prose. Use flowing narrative paragraphs.

Save your output to: ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/[DATE]-[SLUG]-draft.md

AFTER WRITING: Create or update ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/paths.txt with all canonical paths:
```
synthesis_1=[exact path]
synthesis_2=[exact path]
keywords=[exact path]
draft=[exact path]
social=[exact path]
qa=[exact path]
```
```

### Social + QA Agent

```
You are a social media and QA review agent. DO NOT guess or search for file paths.

STEP 1: Read the paths manifest at ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[SLUG]/paths.txt
This file contains the exact paths to all required inputs.

STEP 2: Verify all files exist at the paths listed in paths.txt. If any file is missing, FAIL immediately and report the missing path. Do NOT search for alternatives.

STEP 3: Once verified, read:
- Article draft: [path from paths.txt]
- Synthesis 1: [path from paths.txt]
- Synthesis 2: [path from paths.txt]
- Keywords: [path from paths.txt]

TASK 1: Create social media assets:
- X.com post (engaging, shareable)
- LinkedIn post (professional, detailed)
- Pinterest post (SEO-friendly title 50-70 chars + full summary description)

TASK 2: QA Review:
- Fact-check all claims in the article against source research data
- Grammar and style review
- CRITICAL: Check for em dashes in the article. Flag EVERY instance. Em dashes are FORBIDDEN.
- Verify PhantomByte writing style compliance
- Check SEO keyword placement

Save social media assets to: [social path from paths.txt]
Save QA report to: [qa path from paths.txt]
```

## Trigger Phrases

- "run article blaster"
- "blast an article"
- "write article from research"
- "article pipeline"

## Execution

1. Receive research data file path(s) and topic angle from user. Do **NOT** pre-read the data files.
2. Create output directory: `mkdir -p ~/.hermes/workspace/article-drafts/[slug]/`
3. **Create paths.txt manifest** with canonical paths for all files that will be created
4. **Immediately** execute Phase 2: spawn 2 synthesis agents via `delegate_task`
5. Wait for both to complete.
6. **Verify synthesis files exist** at exact paths in paths.txt
7. Execute Phase 3: spawn 1 keywords agent via `delegate_task`
8. Wait for completion.
9. **Verify keywords file exists** at exact path in paths.txt
10. Execute Phase 4: spawn writer agent via `delegate_task`
11. Wait for completion.
12. **Verify draft file exists** at exact path. If missing, FAIL, do not proceed.
13. Execute Phase 5: spawn social/QA agent via `delegate_task` (reads paths.txt for all locations)
14. Wait for completion.
15. Deliver file paths only (UNC format for Telegram)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Pre-reading data files before Phase 2 (Synthesis agents read their own files; you wasting turns reading everything first is a performance bug)
- Writing Python scripts or orchestration layers to "manage" the pipeline
- Polling or waiting in loops (delegate_task waits automatically)
- Creating `status.json` trackers or background daemon processes
